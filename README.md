# Battleboosters Solana Smart Contract

This repository contains the Solana smart contract code powering the Battleboosters platform.

**Game Scenario: The Prelims Tournament**

Alice, a dedicated player of BattleBoosters, is eager for the upcoming MMA-themed "Prelims Tournament." Here's her journey through the strategic and immersive game environment:
* **Tournament Engagement:** Alice selects the "Prelims Tournament" from the weekly event lineup in BattleBoosters. This event mirrors real-world MMA fights, allowing players to engage by simulating fight outcomes based on strategy rather than chance.
* **Fight Card Selection:** After examining the fight matchups, Alice chooses to participate in a card featuring "Bob," who is fighting in the blue corner. Believing in his performance capabilities, she selects the blue side to support in the game simulation.
* **Fighting Style Strategy:** To bolster her chosen fighter's potential, Alice applies the "Boxing" fighting style card to "Bob." This strategic move aligns with his strengths, potentially enhancing his simulated performance.
* **Strategic Booster Use:** To increase her potential rewards and protect her fighter, Alice strategically applies a Points Booster and a Shield Booster, respectively enhancing the points "Bob" could earn and prolonging his in-game NFT fighter lifespan.
* **Match Anticipation and Simulation:** As the real MMA event plays out, BattleBoosters' sophisticated simulation factors in Aliceâ€™s strategic choices, translating "Bob's" real-world performance into the game.
* **Simulation Results and Rewards:** Victory in the simulation reflects Alice's thoughtful strategy, and her ranking in the tournament is determined. With a strong performance, Alice qualifies for in-game rewards.
* **Reward Collection:** Post-tournament, Alice claims her rewards, which include SOL cryptocurrency, exclusive assets and boosters for future use, from the platform.

**Key Features**

* **Booster Types and Availability:** There are two main types of boosters available: Shield Boosters and Points Boosters. Shield Boosters are used to enhance a fighter's lifespan, providing them with additional durability in battles. Points Boosters, on the other hand, offer fighters a bonus to the points they earn in matches. They are obtained through gameplay achievements, special events, or purchases within the game's ecosystem.
* **Fight Card Integration:**  Boosters can be associated with fight cards, providing enhanced attributes or special abilities to fighters during matches. This integration is handled seamlessly through our smart contract, ensuring that the correct boosters are applied to the right fight cards to affect gameplay as intended.
* **Booster Consumption/Closure:** Our platform treats boosters as single-use items. Once a booster is applied to a fight card and used in a match, it is automatically marked as consumed and closed, preventing any further use. This mechanism is crucial for the game's economic health and competitive balance.
* **Fighter Consumption/Closure:** Fighters in Battleboosters have a limited lifespan that diminishes after each battle. To prolong a fighter's career, players can use Shield Boosters to enhance their lifespan. Once a fighter's lifespan is depleted, they are retired (burned) from the roster.
* **Security & Fairness:** We prioritize security and fairness in all aspects of the Battleboosters platform. Our smart contract includes mechanisms to ensure random booster distribution, prevent cheating, and mitigate exploits. Continuous audits and community feedback are part of our commitment to maintaining a secure and fair gaming environment.
