# Battleboosters Solana Smart Contract

This repository contains the Solana smart contract code powering the Battleboosters platform.

**Key Features**

* **Booster Creation:** Players can create various types of boosters, including Energy Boosters, Shield Boosters, and Power Boosters, each providing unique advantages in battles. The creation process is designed to be straightforward, allowing players to generate new boosters by fulfilling certain criteria or utilizing in-game resources.
* **Fight Card Integration:**  Boosters can be associated with fight cards, providing enhanced attributes or special abilities to fighters during matches. This integration is handled seamlessly through our smart contract, ensuring that the correct boosters are applied to the right fight cards to affect gameplay as intended.
* **Booster Consumption/Closure:** Our platform treats boosters as single-use items. Once a booster is applied to a fight card and used in a match, it is automatically marked as consumed and closed, preventing any further use. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining balance and fairness in the game.
* **Fighter Consumption/Closure:** Fighters in Battleboosters have a limited lifespan that diminishes after each battle. To prolong a fighter's career, players can use Shield Boosters to enhance their lifespan. Once a fighter's lifespan is depleted, they are retired (burned) from the roster.
* **Security & Fairness:** We prioritize security and fairness in all aspects of the Battleboosters platform. Our smart contract includes mechanisms to ensure random booster distribution, prevent cheating, and mitigate exploits. Continuous audits and community feedback are part of our commitment to maintaining a secure and fair gaming environment.
